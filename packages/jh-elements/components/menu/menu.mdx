# Menu

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/pages/components/menu/)

<hr />

Menus display lists of choices or actions. This is not a Navigation component.

## Usage

Import the `<jh-menu>` component:

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-elements/components/menu/menu.js';
```

To use `<jh-menu>`, add menu items, such as `<jh-list-item>`s to the default slot.

```html
<jh-menu>
  <jh-list-item tabindex="0" role="menuitem">Item number 1</jh-list-item>
  <jh-list-item tabindex="0" role="menuitem">Item number 2</jh-list-item>
  <jh-list-item tabindex="0" role="menuitem">Item number 3</jh-list-item>
  <jh-list-item tabindex="0" role="menuitem">Item number 4</jh-list-item>
</jh-menu>
```

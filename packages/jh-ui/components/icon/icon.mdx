# Icon

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/pages/components/icon/)

<hr />

The icon component provides authors with a means to use their own SVG icons while still enabling access
to our design tokens, encouraging consistency across your product. In addition to the icon component, Jack Henry 
also maintains a robust icon library available as raw SVGs and as discrete web components, with each component 
utilizing our design tokens.

Learn more about [iconography](/docs/iconography-overview--docs).

## Usage

Import the `<jh-icon>` component:

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-ui/components/icon/icon.js';
```

To use jh-icon, slot your own SVG markdown in the component's default slot:

```html
<jh-icon size="large">
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path d="M8.53,11.47a.75.75,0,0,0-1.06,1.06L10,15A.75.75,0,0,0,11,15v0h0L16,10.06A.75.75,0,0,0,14.94,9L10.5,13.44Z"/>
    <path d="M12,2.14,3.25,7.06V7.5c0,6.73,2.31,10.24,4.25,12a8.81,8.81,0,0,0,4.41,2.25h.19a8.81,8.81,0,0,0,4.41-2.25c1.94-1.76,4.25-5.26,4.25-12V7.06Zm0,18.1c-.89-.16-7.08-1.66-7.25-12.3L12,3.86l7.25,4.08C19.08,18.59,12.88,20.08,12,20.24Z"/>
  </svg>
</jh-icon>
```

## Accessibility

This component satisfies [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA success criteria. The following success criteria are of concern:

- [WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-content): All non-text content that is presented to the user has 
a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.

### What we provide

The icon component has the following implicit accessibility features, both of which can be overriden by the author. 

- `role="graphics-symbol"`
- `aria-hidden="true"`

### Author guidance

All accessibility considerations should be addressed on the jh-icon element itself and not within the slotted SVG markdown.
Slotted SVGs should not include the `<title>` or `<desc>` elements to ensure consistency in both experience and behavior with 
assistive technology. There are number of issues an author should consider when using the jh-icon component.

- If an icon must be interactive, consider using the icon only variant of our [button](/docs/components-button--docs) component or an `<a>` 
tag wrapper instead. If icon level interactivity is necessary, set `tabindex="0"` on the `<jh-icon>` element.
- Decorative icons, those that are paired with text or are purely for decoration, should be ignore by assistive technology. 
By default the icon component is hidden from assisitive technology. Should interactivity be necessary, set `aria-hidden="false"` 
to avoid anomalous behavior.
- Note that setting a tabindex on the jh-icon while `aria-hidden="true"`, will result in assistive technology honoring browser 
focus and announcing the icon.
- To satisfy [WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-content), use an aria-label attribute when 
no supporting text for the icon is present.

# Checkbox Group

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/pages/components/checkbox-group/)

<hr />

Checkbox groups contain sets of checkboxes where several options can be selected.

## Usage

Import the `<jh-checkbox-group>` component:

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-elements/components/checkbox-group/checkbox-group.js';
```

To use `<jh-checkbox-group>`, add `<jh-checkbox>`s to its slot and any desired properties.

```html
<jh-checkbox-group label="Label">
    <jh-checkbox label="checkbox 1" name="checkbox-1" checked></jh-checkbox>
    <jh-checkbox label="checkbox 2" name="checkbox-2"></jh-checkbox>
    <jh-checkbox label="checkbox 3" name="checkbox-3"></jh-checkbox>
  </jh-checkbox-group>
```

## Dependencies
The checkbox group component makes use of suggested content dependencies.

1. Content -  the following suggested dependencies should be imported when needed: 

- `<jh-checkbox>`. [Checkbox component documentation](/docs/components-checkbox--docs).

## Behaviors
- To ensure that styling is applied correctly to the checkbox group, add only `<jh-checkbox>` components to the slot.
- To set a checkbox in checked state on page load, set the `checked` attribute on the checkbox.
- Checkboxes without a `name` attributed are not submitted in forms. 
- If a checked checkbox does not have a `value` attribute, the string `on` will be submitted in the form.


## Accessibility

This component satisfies [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA success criteria. 
The following success criteria are of concern:

- [WCAG 1.3.1 Information and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html): Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
- [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html): Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- [WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html):
  All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for
   individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's 
   movement and not just the endpoints.
- [WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html):
  Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.
- [WCAG 2.4.7 Focus visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible):
  Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.
- [WCAG 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html): The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except where:
  - Spacing: Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the bounding box of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target;
  - Equivalent: The function can be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets this criterion;
  - Inline: The target is in a sentence or its size is otherwise constrained by the line-height of non-target text;
  - User agent control: The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;
  - Essential: A particular presentation of the target is essential or is legally required for the information being conveyed.
- [WCAG 3.3.1 Error Identification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-identification.html):
  If an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error is identified and the error is described
   to the user in text.
- [WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html):
  Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.
- [WCAG 3.3.3 Error Suggestion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-suggestion.html):
  If an input error is automatically detected and suggestions for correction are known, then the suggestions
   are provided to the user, unless it would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.
- [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, role, value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html):
  For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties,
  and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items
  is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

### What we provide

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) 
and [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value), 
any `label`, `helper-text`, or `error-text` are associated with the checkbox group by default.
- To satisfy [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html), Checkbox Group can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html), 
adequate spacing between checkboxes is provided to ensure the input target size meets the 24 by 24 pixels requirement.

### Author Guidance

- To satisy [WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html), 
when using the `required` property and `show-indicator` attribute, include instructions at the top of 
the form to explain required checkbox groups are marked with a red asterisk.
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html) 
and [WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html), 
ensure the `label` property or `accessible-label` attribute are descriptive.
- To satisfy [WCAG 3.3.1 Error Identification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-identification.html), 
set the `invalid` attribute to generate an `aria-invalid` attribute on checkbox group to indicate an error. 
Utilize the `error-text` attribute to provide feedback on a failed value.
- To satisfy [WCAG 3.3.3 Error Suggestion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-suggestion.html), 
use the `error-text` attribute to provide a suggestion to correct the error when appropriate.
- To satisfy [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value), 
set the `accessible-label` attribute to generate an `aria-label` when a visible label cannot be used.
- `Aria-required` is not supported by checkbox-group. Therefore if checkbox group is `required`, 
authors should provide instructions on the conditions that need to be satisfied via the `helper-text` attribute, or,
 if no visible label is present, via the `accessible-label` attribute.

## Component API

For boolean attributes, true indicates that the attribute has been set without a value: `<jh-checkbox-group required></jh-checkbox-group>`. While false indicates the attribute does not exist in the DOM: `<jh-checkbox-group></jh-checkbox-group>`.

standards that help teams build great products. The design system is informed by internal Jack Henry patterns and extensive
UX research. We've solved many of the common UX problems and baked in accessibilty so that you can focus on your product's

- Reduce time to market through design and code reuse. No need to build from scratch.
- Solving common uses cases, enabling teams to focus on complex problems unique to your product.
- Creating a foundation for accessibility and internationalization.

## Principles

### Framework Agnostic

We have the modern web in mind. Our components are built on native web component technologies and standards that are framework agnostic. You’re not 
locked into a particular framework out of the box and our components will work comfortably within the tech stack of your choice if needed.

### Modular

All our components are designed and engineered to be reusable and work seamlessly together to help you build great applications as quickly as possible 
with as little code as possible.

### Accessible

We've baked in accessibilty support around every corner and aligned with W3C's WCAG standards. Each component is thoughtfully crafted to take into account 
the needs of all users. We've solved common accessibilty issues for you so that you can be confident our components work everywhere and for everyone.

### Consistency

Our components are built with a foundation of robust design tokens that enable white label theming of your products. We've unlocked theming hooks at the
component level enabling precise control over your application's look and feel, helping you achieve a consistent user experience throughout your products.

### Scalable

Our Design System is designed to be scalable, ensuring that it can grow and adapt to meet the evolving needs of our community. To achieve this, we
priortized extensibility and flexibility to ensure our components can be extended for your use cases and adapted to your brand. The Jack Henry Design System 
has community in mind. Our system is constantly evolving with frequent releases that include new features, bug fixes, and qualify of life improvements 
driven by community feedback.

### Performant

We prioritize performance by minimizing code bloat, carefully managing dependencies, and ensuring that our components are lightweight 
and optimized for speed. We achieve this by working as closely to the browser as possible, using modern web technologies to improve performance 
without sacrificing functionality.

### DX Driven

Designer and Developer experience are a core concern and we've invested heavily to ensure our components stay out of your way. With a declarative and intuitive 
API and extensive documentation at your disposal, our components will fit right into your development process without the need to learn a new system, letting 
you focus on solving high impact problems unique to your domain.

## Browser support
All components are tested in the latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

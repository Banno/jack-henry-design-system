# Card

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/v2/components/card/)

<hr />

Cards are content structures that provide an entry point for more complex and detailed information.

## Usage

Import the `<jh-card>` component.

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-elements/components/card/card.js';
```

To use `jh-card`, supply desired properties and slot content within corresponding slot. 

```html
<jh-card header-title="Card Title">
  <div>Card Default Slot</div>
  <div slot="jh-card-footer">Card Footer</div>
</jh-card>
```

## Dependencies
The card component makes use of required compositional dependencies.

1. Composition - the following required dependencies are automatically imported:

- `<jh-divider>`. [Divider component documentation](/docs/components-divider--docs).

## Divider Inset

Card supports header and footer dividers to create a clearer definition before and after the card body. The left inset of the dividers can be adjusted via the following methods:
- To adjust the left inset of each divider individually, use the `header-divider-inset` and `footer-divider-inset` attributes which supports a range from 0px to 96px with a step of 8px.
- To set the left inset to a value outside of the divider-inset attribute range, or for multiple dividers at once, omit the divider-inset attributes and use the `--jh-divider-inset-space` component token instead.
- For multiple dividers with varying inset requirements, use the divider-inset attribute in conjuction with the `--jh-divider-inset-space` component token. Note that the divider-inset attribute will override the component token where present.

## Accessibility

This component satisfies [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA success criteria. The following success criteria are of concern:

- [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html): Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.

- [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html): Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.

### What we provide

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html), the `headerTitle` property is assigned to an h2 heading by default. To change the heading level, use the `title-heading-level` attribute.

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html), Card can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.

## Component API

For boolean attributes, true indicates that the attribute has been set without a value: `<jh-card show-header-divider></jh-card>`. While false indicates the attribute does not exist in the DOM: `<jh-card></jh-card>`.

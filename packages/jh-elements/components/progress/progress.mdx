# Progress

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/v2/components/progress/)

<hr />

A progress indicator provides feedback to a user regarding loading and waiting states.

## Usage

Import the `<jh-progress>` component.

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-elements/components/progress/progress.js';
```

To use `jh-progress`, set any desired properties. 

```html
<jh-progress label="label" indeterminate></jh-progress>
```

## Accessibility

This component satisfies [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA success criteria. The following success criteria are of concern:

- [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html): Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.

- [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html): For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

### What we provide

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html), Progress can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.

- The progress indicator has a `role` of progressbar and generates an `aria-valuenow` attribute when the `value` property is set. Exposing the role enables screen reader users to understand the progress indicator and it's current status.

- The progress component has the following implicit accessibility features, which can be overridden by setting the `min` and `max` properties:

  - `aria-valuemin="0"`
  - `aria-valuemax="100"`

### Author Guidance

- To satisfy [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html), set an `accessible-label` to generate an `aria-label` when a visible label cannot be used.

- Set the `accessible-valuetext` attribute to generate an `aria-valuetext` attribute when the rendered value cannot be meaningfully represensented as a number.

## Component API

For boolean attributes, true indicates that the attribute has been set without a value: `<jh-progress indeterminate></jh-progress>`. While false indicates the attribute does not exist in the DOM: `<jh-progress></jh-progress>`.

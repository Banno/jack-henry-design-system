# Checkbox

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/pages/components/checkbox/)

<hr />

Checkboxes allow users to select one or more options from a group of options.

## Usage

Import the `<jh-checkbox>` component:

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-ui/components/checkbox/checkbox.js';
```

To use `<jh-checkbox>`:

```html
<jh-checkbox checked></jh-checkbox>
```

## Indeterminate Checkboxes

- A checkbox in an indeterminate state provides a visual indication that the actual state of the checkbox (checked or unchecked), cannot be determined.
- Any interaction with an indeterminate checkbox will set its state to checked.
- Indeterminate checkboxes do not participate in form submission, even if checked=true.

## Accessibility

This component satisfies [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA success criteria.
The following success criteria are of concern:

- [WCAG 1.3.1 Information and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html):
  Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
- [WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color):
  Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
- [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html): Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- [WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html):
  Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.
- [WCAG 2.4.7 Focus visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible):
  Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.
- [WCAG 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum):
The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except where:
  - Spacing: Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the bounding box of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target;
  - Equivalent: The function can be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets this criterion;
  - Inline: The target is in a sentence or its size is otherwise constrained by the line-height of non-target text;
  - User agent control: The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;
  - Essential: A particular presentation of the target is essential or is legally required for the information being conveyed.
- [WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html):
  Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input.
- [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, role, value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html):
  For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties,
  and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items
  is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

### What we provide

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.3.1 Information and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) and [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, role, value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html), the checkbox is programmatically connected to its label and helper text (when used).
- To satisfy [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html), Checkbox can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.4.7 Focus visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible), the cursor changes shape to indicate that the checkbox can be operated and the checkbox receives a visible border when it is focused.
- To satisfy [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, role, value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html), the state of the checkbox is communicated by the native input: checked/unchecked/mixed(indeterminate) and `aria-describedby` is used to connect the helper-text to the checkbox.

### Author Guidance

- To satisfy [WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html) and [WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html), `label` and`helper-text` are made available to provide clear labels and instructions.
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels.html) and [WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/labels-or-instructions.html), when no visible label is provided, `accessible-label` should be used to provide an `aria-label` for the checkbox.
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum), 
when using multiple checkboxes, use a `<jh-checkbox-group>`, which includes appropriate spacing between checkboxes by design. 
When using  a single `<jh-checkbox>`, make sure to provide adequate spacing around the checkbox to meet the 24 by 24 pixels minimum target size requirement.
## Component API

For boolean attributes, true indicates that the attribute has been set without a value: `<jh-checkbox indeterminate></jh-checkbox>`. While false indicates the attribute does not exist in the DOM: `<jh-checkbox></jh-checkbox>`.

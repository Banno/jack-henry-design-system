# Installing

The design system is comprised of three NPM packages. Our main package `@jack-henry/jh-ui`includes the jh-icons and jh-core packages as dependencies. Installing 
jh-ui will install the entire design system which includes:

- `jh-core`: Design tokens and themes that power our web components
- `jh-icons`: Icon set that includes raw icon SVGs and web component icons
- `jh-ui`: Web component UI library

This is the fastest way to get started. To install, run the following command:

With npm:

```bash
npm install @jack-henry/jh-ui
```

With pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install @jack-henry/jh-ui
```

With yarn:

```bash
yarn add @jack-henry/jh-ui
```

# List Group

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/pages/components/list-group/)

<hr />

 The list group component is a container used to group together list items within a list.
 List items and list groups are used as building blocks in complex
 components such as lists, menus, and dropdowns.

## Usage

Import the `<jh-list-group>` component: 

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-ui/components/list-group/list-group.js';
```

To use `jh-list-group`, place jh-list-items into the default slot. Use the label attribute to provide an optional subheader.

```html
<jh-list-group label="subheader">
    <jh-list-item>List item 1</jh-list-item>
    <jh-list-item>List item 2</jh-list-item>
    <jh-list-item>List item 3</jh-list-item>
</jh-list-group>
```

## Dependencies
The list group component makes use of suggested content dependencies.

1. Content -  the following suggested dependencies should be imported when needed: 

- `<jh-list-item>`. [List item component documentation](/docs/components-list-item--docs).

## Accessibility

This component satisfies [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA success criteria. The following success criteria are of concern:

- [WCAG 1.3.1 Information and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html): Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
- [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html): Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html):
For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values 
that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available 
to user agents, including assistive technologies.

### What we provide

 - To satisfy [WCAG 1.3.1 Information and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html) and 
 [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html), list-group has a role of `group`.
 - To satisfy [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html), List Group can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
 - To satisfy [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html), when the `label` attribute is present, an `id` is auto-generated to connect it to the group.
 - If no subheader is desired, use the `accessible-label` attribute, which will generate an `aria-label`.

### Author guidance

- The group role and its boundaries are not announced by screen readers for groups without an accessible name. 
To provide an accessible name, either use the `label` attribute to provide a subheader, or, if no subheader is desired, 
use the `accessible-label` attribute, which will generate an `aria-label`.

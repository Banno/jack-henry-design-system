# Notification

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/pages/components/notification/)

<hr />

The notification component displays information to the user, and supports both alerts and banner type notifications. Alert types are best suited for information that should be conveyed in response to a specific user action, while banner types are best suited for general or persistant information. 

## Usage

Import the `<jh-notification>` component:

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-ui/components/notification/notification.js';
```

To use `<jh-notification>`, set desired properties and slotted content as needed.

```html
<jh-notification appearance="neutral" type="banner">
  <p>Text</p>
  <jh-icon-information slot="jh-notification-icon"></jh-icon-information>
  <jh-button label="Button" slot="jh-notification-action"></jh-button>
</jh-notification>
```
## Dependencies
The notification component makes use of both required compositional and suggested content related dependencies.

1. Composition - the following required dependencies are automatically imported:

- `<jh-button>`. [Button component documentation](/docs/components-button--docs).
- `<jh-icon-xmark>` . [Iconography documentation](/docs/iconography-overview--docs).

2. Content -  the following suggested dependencies should be imported when needed: 

- `<jh-icon>`. [Iconography documentation](/docs/iconography-overview--docs).

## Action Slot Guidance

- The action slot is intended to be a wrapper for action buttons for which we encourage the use of the `jh-button` component to streamline styles as well as to enhance the accessibility of the component as outlined in the Accessibility documentation.
- The notification component will override the size of any slotted `jh-button` to `size="small"` in order to ensure consistent alignment of buttons within the action slot. 
- When using action buttons, avoid setting long labels and instead opt to use language that is specific and concise.

## Accessibility

This component satisfies [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA success criteria. The following success criteria are of concern:

- [WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html): 
  Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
- [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html): Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- [WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html):
  All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.
- [WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html):
  If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
- [WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html):
  Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.
- [WCAG 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html): The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except where:
  - Spacing: Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the bounding box of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target;
  - Equivalent: The function can be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets this criterion;
  - Inline: The target is in a sentence or its size is otherwise constrained by the line-height of non-target text;
  - User agent control: The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;
  - Essential: A particular presentation of the target is essential or is legally required for the information being conveyed.
- [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html):
  For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values
  that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available
  to user agents, including assistive technologies.
- [WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html):
  In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.

### What we provide

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html), Notification can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html), the dismiss button is keyboard operable and can be activated via the `Spacebar` and `Enter` keys.
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html), Notification does not trap users in content. 
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html), the dismiss button contains focus visible styles to help users determine which element has keyboard focus.
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html), the target size of the dismiss button is at least 24 by 24 pixels for users to easily activate it.

### Author guidance

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html), ensure that information conveyed through the notification appearance is also available in text. 
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html) when slotting buttons within the action slot, ensure that the buttons are keyboard operable and can be activated via the `Spacebar` and `Enter` keys. Use of the `jh-button` component will also satisfy this success criterion. 
- To satisfy [WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html) when slotting buttons within the action slot, ensure that the buttons contain focus visible styles to help users determine which element has keyboard focus. Use of the `jh-button` component will also satisfy this success criterion. 
- To satisfy [WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html), ensure that when using a dismiss button an `accessible-label` is set to support screen readers.
- To satisfy [WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html), ensure the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Notifications are presented to users without receiving focus.</li>
    <li>The live region in which the notification is added to has either the role of "status" when the notification represents the result of a successful action or the state of an application, or the role of "alert" when the notification conveys a suggestion, or a warning on the existence of an error.</li>
  </ol>

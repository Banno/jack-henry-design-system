# Overview

The Jack Henry Design System includes a robust set of icons that cover widely recognized metaphors. Our icons are designed 
to provide a consistent look and feel across your products. The icons are available as an npm package which is currently
installed as a dependency in the jh-ui package. The icon package includes the following:

- SVG icon files
- ES module based web components for each icon
- A utility to convert your own SVG icons to web components.

Our icon set is continuously growing and updated with new icons frequently.

## Using our icons

We provide icons in two formats.

### SVG icons

SVG icons can be used throughout your application if you need complete control. Doing so however, will require building in 
your own support for our design tokens if you want to ensure consistency.

### Web component icons

Using our web component icons is the preferred path. Using component based icons provide the following benefits:

- Supports component driven developent and makes it easy to reuse icons throughout your app.
- Helps ensure consistency by hooking into our design tokens.
- Supports build processes such as tree shaking and code splitting via ES modules.

Here's how to use one. [Search our icon set](https://jackhenry.design/pages/foundations/icons/) for an icon.
Take note of its name as that will be the file name you import. Import the desired icon component and use it:

```javascript
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit';
import '@jack-henry/jh-icons/icons-wc/icon-arrow-left.js';

class MyWidget extends LitElement {

  render() {
    return html`<jh-icon-arrow-left size="large"></jh-icon-arrow-left>`;
  }
}
```

Our web component icons expose a size property and a number of component level styling hooks to help with theming.
The api is identical to our [jh-icon component](/docs/components-icon--docs).

## Using your own icons

We recognize that there will be times where you want to use your own icon set. Or perhaps use several, including ours. We
have you covered with two options to help you include your own icons.

### Jh-icon

We built a discrete `jh-icon` component that enables slotting your own SVG code and still hook into our design tokens, 
ensuring consistency across your iconography. You can view the [jh-icon component docs](/docs/components-icon--docs) to learn more.

### Converting SVGs to Web Components

We've included a conversion utility to help you convert your own icons to web components and leverage our
design tokens.

The generate-wc.js utility accepts the following arguments:
- sourcePath - The path to the directory where your raw SVG icons are stored.
- outputPath - The destination folder where the created web components will be output.
- prefix - A string that will be prepended to each icon name. This establishes a namespace for your icons to ensure
no naming collisions. A `-` dash character will be inserted after the provided prefix.

Usage example:

```
node @jack-henry/jh-icons/bin/generate-wc.js sourcePath outputPath prefix
```

Please note that any files with the same filename as the output web component will be overwritten in the outputPath.

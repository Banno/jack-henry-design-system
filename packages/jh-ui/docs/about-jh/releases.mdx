# Releases

The Jack Henry Design System maintains regular release cycle. All Design System assets from both design and engineering, with the exception of some documentation, are versioned together. This means that with each release, changes to Figma UI kits, design tokens, component code, and documentation are all aligned with the same release number and published simultaneously. 

All releases adhere to [Semantic Versioning principles](https://semver.org/), using a three-part version number: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**. 

This system ensures our consumers can expect the scope and impact of any update.

# Tag Group

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/pages/components/tag-group/)

<hr />

A tag group is used to group `<jh-tag>` components to provide layout and alignment support. 

## Usage

Import the `<jh-tag-group>` component:

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-elements/components/tag-group/tag-group.js';
```

To use `<jh-tag-group>`: 

```html
<jh-tag-group alignment="start">
    <jh-tag label="label 1"></jh-tag>
    <jh-tag label="label 2"></jh-tag>
    <jh-tag label="label 3"></jh-tag>
</jh-tag-group>
```

## Tag truncation

- By default, tag groups will grow to accommodate the size of their content. Authors can set a width or max-width on tag-group but should note that setting a width on tag-group that is smaller than the default `max-width` of jh-tag (200px) will cause tag(s) to truncate. 
- The tag max-width can also be adjusted by setting the `--jh-tag-size-max-width` token. If the token value is set to `auto`, the tag(s) will automatically truncate at the width of the tag-group.

## Dependencies
The tag group component makes use of suggested content dependencies.

1. Content -  the following suggested dependencies should be imported when needed: 

- `<jh-tag>`. [Tag component documentation](/docs/components-tag--docs).

## Accessibility

This component satisfies [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) AA success criteria. 
The following success criteria are of concern:

- [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html): 
  Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.
- [WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html):
  In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.

### What we provide

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html), the tag group has a role of `group`.

### Author Guidance

- To satisfy [WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html), authors should provide adequate roles to the `jh-tag`s inside the tag group.
- To satisfy [WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html), when tags are added and/or removed
dynamically from the tag group, authors should ensure that the tag group is set up as a live region:
    - setting `aria-live` to `polite`is preferred, so announcements will not disrupt the user's work flow.
    - setting `aria-relevant` to `additions removals` will announce both tag additions and removals. If it is omitted, only additions will be announced.
    - setting `aria-atomic` to `true` is only needed if the whole live-region needs to be announced. If it is omitted, only new addtions and removals will be announced.
- To ensure that tag groups are announced correctly by screen readers, authors should provide an `aria-label`.

# Divider

[Guidelines](https://jackhenry.design/v2/components/divider/)

<hr />

Dividers are used to group content vertically at the page or component level and should be used when whitespace does not provide a clear enough separation. 

## Usage

Import the `<jh-divider>` component.

```javascript
import '@jack-henry/jh-elements/components/divider/divider.js';
```

Declaring a `jh-divider`:

```html
<jh-divider inset="8"></jh-divider>
```

## Inset Override

There are thirteen left-inset options available to help align the divider with its associated content. If an inset outside of the thirteen provided options is desired, use the `--jh-divider-inset-space` component token. Note that if both the `inset` property and `--jh-divider-inset-space` component token are present, the `inset` property will take priority for that instance of the component. 

## Accessibility

Because Divider is non-focusable and decorative there are no accessibility concerns. 

## Component API

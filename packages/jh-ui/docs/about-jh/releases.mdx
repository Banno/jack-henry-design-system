# Releases

The Jack Henry Design System maintains a regular release cycle where design and engineering assets are released in coordination. While major versions are synchronized across design and code, minor updates, such as Figma UI kit updates or component code changes, may be released independently.

All releases adhere to [Semantic Versioning principles](https://semver.org/), using a three-part version number: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**. 

This system ensures our consumers can expect the scope and impact of any update.
